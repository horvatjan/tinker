  <h2>Disputes</h2>

  <h3>1) Indemnification</h3>
  <p>By agreeing to these Terms you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Tinkchat, our managing members, shareholders, employees, affiliates, licensors and/or suppliers (the "Tinkchat Parties") from and against any and all charges, claims, complaints, costs, damages, expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys' fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to (a) your use of the Service; (b) any User Content you post, upload, use, store, distribute, or otherwise transmit through the Service; (c) your violation of these Terms; or (d) your violation of the rights of another.</p>

  <h3>2) Limitation of Liability</h3>
  <p>Except where prohibited by law, in no event will Tinkchat or the Tinkchat Parties be liable for any indirect, special, punitive, incidental, exemplary or consequential damages that result from (a) the use of, or inability to use, the Service; (b) the provision of the Service or any materials available therein; or (c) the conduct of other users of the Service, even if Tinkchat has been advised of the possibility of such damages. You assume total responsibility for your use of the Service. Your only remedy against Tinkchat for dissatisfaction with the Service or any content is to stop using the Service. If, notwithstanding these Terms, Tinkchat is found liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Service or any content, Tinkchat's liability shall in no event exceed $1.00. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.</p>

  <h3>3) Arbitration</h3>
  <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH TINKCHAT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>

  <p>You and Tinkchat agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or your use of the Service, except that you and Tinkchat are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Tinkchat agree (a) that any arbitration will occur in Ljubljana, Slovenia; (b) that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and (c) that Slovenia or slovene courts have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit, if any, between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND TINKCHAT WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.</p>

  <h3>4) Forum and Venue</h3>
  <p>A lawsuit, if any, by you or Tinkchat against the other will occur in court in Ljubljana, Slovenia. You and Tinkchat agree that the jurisdiction and venue of these courts is exclusive.</p>


  <h2>Applicable Law</h2>
  <p>Any dispute between you and Tinkchat will be governed by these Terms and the laws of Slovenia and those of European Union, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.</p>


  <h2>Severability</h2>
  <p>If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>


  <h2>Complete Agreement</h2>
  <p>These Terms supersede all prior understandings regarding the same and represent the complete agreement between you and Tinkchat.</p>


  <h2>Changes to Terms of Use</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to change these terms at any time. When we do, we will notify you of the change via email address you provided. You may opt out of these notifications whereby you become solely responsible for staying up to date with these terms.</p>
